## Hi, I'm Patrick! 👋

I'm an experienced front-end developer with a solid background in everything related to online-marketing on top. It is my passion to build slick & well optimized websites and web apps. 

I’m very much into gaming and learning to work with new technologies, always improving myself to stay on top of my field. Further, I like nature and enjoy doing some trekking from time to time. Finally, I'm a good person to have a beer 🍻 with.
